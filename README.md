[Biogenesis](https://biogenesis.sourceforge.net/) is an open source project which simulates, in a visual fashion, the processes involved in the evolution of unicellular organisms in a virtual lab. In such simulated environment, each segment does something different based on its color (e.g. green-segmented organisms are able to perform photosynthesis, whereas gray segments kill an organism when in contact with it). It has always fascinated me how natural selection occurs even in such a bidimensional virtual environment with some very simple rules.

Over time, some patterns emerge: defense segments get placed where more appropriate for the survival of the organisms (typically the outer part), and organisms specialize; plant-like organisms may arise, for instance, which have protected photosynthetic segments; also predators (which I always called "mosquitoes", given the resemblance) may arise, which move fast and have segments that steal organic matter from other organisms. Such phenomenon can be seen in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqd1fjhiJbg).

There was no feature to fast-forward the simulation, however, to speed up the process of evolution. As such, I've decided to modify the project and include such a functionality; now it's possible, with the press of a button, fast-forward frames in the simulation, and it gets easier to see the outcome of the evolution process.

Building: just import the project folder onto IntelliJ and run the build command.
